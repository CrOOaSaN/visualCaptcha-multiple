visualCaptcha-multiple [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emotionLoop/visualCaptcha-multiple.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emotionLoop/visualCaptcha-multiple)
==================

PHP sample for visualCaptcha with multiple captchas. [You can also see it live](http://multiple.demo.visualcaptcha.net).

This is exactly the same as the [PHP Demo](https://github.com/emotionLoop/visualCaptcha-PHP), just with a different HTML to show you multiple captchas work, as long as each has one form only.

A demo/sample PHP app that uses the [visualcaptcha composer/packagist package](https://github.com/emotionLoop/visualCaptcha-packagist) and the [visualcaptcha jQuery plugin bower package](https://github.com/emotionLoop/visualCaptcha-frontend-jquery), as a proof-of-concept for how to integrate it with your PHP project.
